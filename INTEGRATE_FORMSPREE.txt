// Instructions for integrating Formspree with your Vue contact form

1. Go to https://formspree.io and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new form and copy the endpoint URL provided (it will look like https://formspree.io/f/yourformid).
3. In your Contact.vue, update the <form> tag to use the Formspree endpoint and method="POST":

<form class="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/yourformid" method="POST">
  <!-- form fields -->
</form>

4. Make sure each input has a name attribute (e.g., name="name", name="email", name="message").
5. Remove the Vue submit handler (e.g., @submit.prevent) for a simple HTML form submission, or use fetch/AJAX for a custom experience.
6. Test the formâ€”submissions will go to your email!

If you want, I can update your Contact.vue automatically. Just provide your Formspree endpoint URL.
